These scripts work for me to download and import the leginfo data. I use MySQL (5.7.32 Homebrew) on Mac OS X 10.15.4 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.

I welcome pull-requests with improvements. If anyone is interested in ways to make the scripts work for other databases, I would be very open
to that, though I would try to prevent breakage with MySQL.

thanx - ray
